                <h2>1. General information</h2>
                <p>
                    On this page you will find important information on data protection at FABER Lotto GmbH & Co. KG
                    (hereinafter Faber). We process certain personal data from you when you visit this website and when you
                    use Faber products. Faber is responsible for processing your personal data. Data protection information
                    from the other companies in the FABER group can be found on the websites of FABER Lotto-Service GmbH,
                    FABER Staatliche Lotterie Erwerb KG and FABER Premium Gewinnspiel GmbH.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First of all, we would like to point out that we follow the statutory provisions in all data processing
                    operations (e.g. collection, transmission, use, blocking or deletion). The protection of your privacy
                    and the preservation of gaming secrecy are of the utmost importance to us. We treat the data we need to
                    process orders and maintain customer relationships with the appropriate level of responsibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aim of our data protection measures is to comply with the requirements of the EU General Data
                    Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and to protect your privacy and
                    personal sphere. This declaration is intended to inform you about our data protection measures.
                </p>
    
    
                <h2>2. For what purpose are my data processed?</h2>
                <h3>Order processing and advertising</h2>
                    <p>
                        Faber collects and uses your personal data to enable you to use our products (order processing). To do this, we process your personal inventory data such as name, address, date of birth, email address, telephone number, password, all necessary game data (such as the lottery lines played, ticket numbers, receipt numbers), payment data (such as your bank details and the amounts paid in or out) and personal website settings on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 b) GDPR. Without this personal data, we cannot carry out the contractual relationship with you
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Faber also uses your name and address as well as data on the type and extent of participation in our gaming offers on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 f) GDPR for written advertising for its own offers and offers from other companies in the FABER group of companies. Faber also uses commissioned service providers (e.g. letter shops) for this purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Faber uses your email address on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 b) GDPR as part of order processing to send order confirmations, order confirmations and game receipts. We also send you game information in the form of drawing results, winning odds and winning notifications. You can adjust your settings for notification of game information at any time in your account settings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Faber also uses your email address - unless you have objected - to send you information about its own products and services. Faber provides information about current jackpots, game recommendations and news about lotteries and lotteries in a regular newsletter. In addition, we will send you personal offers for our games on faber.de or similar products. You can object to this advertising use of your email address at any time by making the appropriate settings in your customer account, clicking on the unsubscribe link in an advertising email or by sending a message to our customer service. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 f) GDPR (our legitimate interests in customer communication).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Faber will only use your telephone number for advertising purposes with your express consent. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 a) GDPR. In this respect, you are not obliged to give Faber your consent to process your personal data in this way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the purposes stated above, some of your data will also be passed on to external service providers commissioned by Faber (in particular IT service providers, payment processing service providers and trustees), who may only process this data for the purposes stated above in accordance with our instructions.
                        For the legally required verification of your age (participation from 18), your name, address and date of birth are passed on to a recognized service provider (usually Schufa Holding AG, Riser-ID Services GmbH or Deutsche Post AG). If the age verification is carried out via Schufa Holding AG and is successful, your bank details are sent to Schufa Holding AG to check whether the bank details are stored there and can be assigned to you. In this case, the age verification can be completed by a 1 cent transfer. To protect players, your contact details are also compared with a list of blocked players where legally required. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 b), c) GDPR in conjunction with Section 4 Para. 5 No. 1 of the State Treaty on Gambling (Gl√ºStV). More information on SCHUFA's activities can be viewed online at www.schufa.de/datenschutz. A credit check or the transmission of different bank details does not take place. The respective service provider will save the request for the period required for proof purposes. The statement that you are of legal age is also stored internally at Faber as further proof.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your data will not be stored for longer than is legally permitted and necessary for the purposes stated above (including the fulfillment of post-contractual obligations). After that, your data will be deleted unless there are statutory retention periods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Handling data from the contact form
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you send a request via our contact form, this data will be transmitted in encrypted form and stored on our server so that it can be used to process and answer your request and in the event of follow-up questions. If your request relates to an offer from another company in the FABER group of companies, we will forward your request to the relevant company for processing. This data will be stored for as long as it is necessary to process the request. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 b) GDPR or (for requests about products from other companies in the FABER group of companies) Art. 6 Para. 1 f) GDPR.

                        Usage data and cookies <br>
                        We use cookies to ensure the functionality of our website and to make it easier for you to use our services (for example by displaying a shopping cart) as well as for analysis purposes, to advertise and further improve our services. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 f) GDPR. When you first visit our website, you can select which cookies may be stored on your device. The session cookie cannot be deselected as it is required for important website functions. Cookies set by Facebook that we use for analysis and advertising purposes can be deactivated (for more information, see Facebook Custom Audiences). You can also visit our website without cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser. If your browser does not allow cookies, you may not be able to access all functions of our website without restrictions.

                    <p>
                        We also store certain usage data such as IP addresses and login times in internal log files to monitor and improve the functionality of our website and to correct technical errors on our website. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 f) GDPR. The log files are not used for usage analysis, but solely for analysis purposes in the event of attacks on our website or technical errors in the functionality of our website. The data contained in the log files is regularly deleted after six months at the latest.

                        Use of Google Analytics To optimize and analyze our online offering, we use the "Google Analytics" service, which is offered by Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA), based on our legitimate interests on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 f) GDPR.  Google LLC is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and therefore guarantees a level of data protection comparable to European data protection law.  The IP address of users of our website is shortened within the European Economic Area, where the same data protection regulations apply as in Germany. Only in individual cases is the IP address initially transmitted in full to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. This shortening eliminates the personal reference to your IP address. The user's IP address transmitted by the browser is under no circumstances combined with other data stored by Google.  The data collected by Google on our behalf is used within the framework of the data processing agreement that we, as website operators, have concluded with Google LLC in order to evaluate the use of our online offering, to improve our online offering and to provide other services associated with the use of our online offering and internet usage. The data is deleted 14 months after collection.  You can prevent information (including your IP address) from being sent to Google LLC and used by Google LLC by downloading the Google Analytics deactivation add-on for browsers.  Alternatively, you can prevent Google from collecting data about you on this website by clicking on "Disable Google Analytics". By clicking on the link above, you download an "opt-out cookie". Your browser must therefore generally allow cookies to be stored for this purpose. If you delete your cookies regularly, you will need to click on the link again each time you visit this website.  Further information on data usage by Google, setting options and objection options can be found in Google's privacy policy and in the settings for the display of advertisements by Google (provided you have a Google account and are logged in there).  Facebook Custom Audiences On faber.de we use the remarketing function "Custom Audiences" from Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, ("Facebook"). This function is used to present interest-based advertisements ("Facebook Ads") to visitors to this website when they visit the social network Facebook.  For this purpose, "Facebook Pixel" is implemented on our websites. When you visit our pages, a direct connection is established between your browser and the Facebook server via this tracking pixel. Facebook therefore receives information from your browser, among other things, that our page has been accessed from your device. We would like to point out that we have no influence on the scope of the data transmitted and its further use by Facebook. By integrating Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding web page on our website or clicked on an ad from us. If you are registered with a Facebook service, Facebook can assign the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Facebook or have not logged in, there is a possibility that the provider will find out and save your IP address and other identification features.  Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield, so that an appropriate level of data protection exists according to the European Commission's implementing decision. The certificate can be viewed here. You can object to the use of Facebook Website Custom Audiences at any time for the future here and here. You can find more information on data protection and your settings options here and here.

                        Faber uses highly developed and proven protection mechanisms in both the technical and organizational areas to keep all data confidential. All sensitive data is transferred using SSL data encryption. All of your information is therefore protected from access by unauthorized third parties and is only accessible internally to a limited group of people to the extent necessary for the service-oriented processing of our business relationship and for the communication purposes described above. In your and our own interest, we always take care to implement the latest technical possibilities in our systems when securing your data.

                        Under the legal requirements, the existence of which must be checked in each individual case, you can request information about your personal data and have the right to correction, deletion, restriction of processing, objection to processing and data portability. You can object to the use of the data for advertising purposes or the collection of pseudonymized usage data at any time by sending an email to datenschutz@faber.de or by telephone on 0234-9383333 or, if the data processing is based on your consent, you can revoke your consent at any time. We would like to point out that the processing of your personal data until you revoke your consent remains lawful in accordance with the statutory provisions. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
